## Description

Commentat crowdsources reviews of local businesses so that consumers are armed with the best possible information before making a decision about where they want to spend their money. They have essentially democratized restaurant (and other business) ratings and reviews so that we no longer need to rely on an oligopoly of opinions (i.e. food critics); we can instead make decisions based on the experiences of a much larger samples size â€“ everybody with an internet connection.

## Overview

For our server side we built it using Django 
which is a Web framework written in Python, 
we deployed it on Heroku and connected it 
to our databse which is stored on ElephentSQL
and for our client side we used NextJS 
we deployed it using vercel.

Finally, we used docker containers
as a development tool to manage these two 
applicati.
